This site is hosted with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). The source code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/cadojo/loopy.software).

## Website Development

A new and fantastic tool for literate programming, [Quarto](https://quarto.org),
is used to develop and render this site. The full website theme is built on 
top of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com); specifically, the 
`Pulse` [Quarto Theme](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html)
is used for this website. 

## Fun Facts

None of the fun facts shown on the site homepage are originally created by me! They are all from various
sources on the internet. I'll add proper citations soon!
