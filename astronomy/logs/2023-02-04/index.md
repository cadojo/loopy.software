## Summary

I drove one hour south of Houston to Brazos Bend State Park. This park
hosts the George Observatory, but I didn't set up at the observatory. I drove around the 
back of the observatory to a parking lot next to a lake for fishing. The moon was one night 
short of the Snow Moon, and it was so bright it hurt to look at through the telescope. I 
looked at Orion's Belt, Mairen's Nebula below Orion, and Sirius.
