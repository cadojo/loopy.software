## Summary

Casey and I went to the park to try out the telescope together. We set up with a blanket in 
a field below the pavilion; it was a nice spot! We were able to find Mars
(well, Casey was able to find Mars) and we used every eyepiece I have: 25mm, 10mm, and 3mm.
We also used the Barlow Lens with the 3mm piece, which produced a very blurry (but large)
view of Mars. It was very, very red. Cool!
