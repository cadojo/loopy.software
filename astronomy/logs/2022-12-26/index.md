## Summary

I used my ST 80 for the first time! It was freezing out, so I wasn't out too long. I set the
telescope up at the front steps of my childhood home. I them moved the telescope onto the 
lawn to avoid a streetlight's ray, and I eventually moved to the edge of the driveway for 
the same reason. I only looked at Jupiter, and could only successfully view Jupiter with the 
25mm and 10mm lenses. My dad helped me set up the telescope mount in its altitude / azimuth 
configuration, and he helped find Jupiter with the 10mm lens. I don't think we used the 
barlow lens with either eyepiece. When using the 3mm eyepiece, all we saw was dark. I think 
we were just not looking in the right place, but I'm still don't fully understand why we 
didn't see _any_ stars with the 3mm eyepiece. It was a lot of fun! We ultimately saw 
Jupiter, and two of Jupiter's moons laid out diagonally from Jupiter's lower left to upper 
right. The moons were tiny, but very bright. I remember feeling extremely excited to use the 
telescope again.
