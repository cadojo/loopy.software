:::{#about-heading}

I'm a professional spaceflight controls engineer, and an open source
scientific software hobbyist. Ease of exploration through computation
is my favorite (discretionary) benefit of our technological world. Read
my informal [writing](/blog/) to learn more about the silly projects I 
work on in spare time. Speaking of, my personal projects are usually 
available as open source software [packages](/packages)!
