### About Me

I'm a professional spaceflight controls engineer, and an open source
scientific software hobbyist. I owe my love of scientific computing 
to my (astro)dynamics & controls engineering coursework. Computation
is still the best educational tool I have. In spare time,
I love exploring physical concepts through code; primarily [Julia](https://julialang.org)!
Read my informal [writing](/blog/) to learn more about the silly projects I 
work on in spare time. Speaking of, my personal projects are usually 
available as open source [software](/packages)! 

## Highlight

Check out my in-development robotic manipulator kinematics package, [`KinematicChains.jl`](https://github.com/cadojo/KinematicChains.jl)! I'm currently tutoring two graduate robotics students. I hope `KinematicChains.jl` serves as a useful educational tool for them, and for other students who are interested in robotics at the college or graduate level.
