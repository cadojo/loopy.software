## Self Published 

### Replicated ROA Analysis

I replicated nonlinear region of attraction analysis completed by 
[Chakraborty et al](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0967066110002595)
for a graduate nonlinear controls course project. While the estimation methods were not 
replicated, the polynomial approximation was replicated with Python, and the results were summarized
in a [technical paper](https://github.com/cadojo/Replicated-ROA-Analysis/blob/main/Report/Carpinelli_ROA_Estimation.pdf).
The polynomial dynamics have since been ported to Julia with [`PolynomialGTM.jl`](https://github.com/cadojo/PolynomialGTM.jl).

### Manifold Transfers

I investigated low-cost manifold-based interplanetary transfer designs as part of a graduate astrodynamics
course project. The results were summarized in a 
[final paper](https://github.com/cadojo/CR3BP-Manifold-Research/blob/main/papers/manifold-transfers/tex/Carpinelli_Manifold_Transfers.pdf).
This investigation is ongoing! I'm expecting to produce a follow up paper with calculation 
corrections, and new results, in 2022. As part of this project, a list of thousands of initial conditions for periodic 
orbits in our solar system was published on [GitHub](https://github.com/cadojo/CR3BP-Manifold-Research/tree/main/data/processed/halos)!
