## 2022 JSC Hackathon

In January 2022, I presented an [Introduction to Julia](https://github.com/cadojo/jsc-hackathon-2022).
I talked about how computers work â€” from binary math, to computer chips, to keyboard inputs.
At the end of the [presentation](./jsc-hackathon-2022.html), we explored bundles of orbits 
in outer space with Julia code!



## 2021 JuliaCon

As a graduate student, I developed an open-source astrodynamics package called
[GeneralAstrodynamics.jl](https://github.com/cadojo/GeneralAstrodynamics.jl). I used this 
package to investigate invariant-manifold-based Earth-Jupiter transfer designs.
This JuliaCon talk provides a brief introduction to astrodynamics, scientific 
computing, and Julia. The presentation slides and 
[Pluto](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) notebook are available on 
[GitHub](https://github.com/cadojo/juliacon).
