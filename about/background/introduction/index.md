subtitle: "_My background, history, and interests._"

I grew up in New Jersey, and studied electrical and aerospace engineering in Maryland. 
I'm currently working as a Guidance, Navigation, & Controls engineer in Texas in support of human spaceflight 
and space exploration projects. I spend free time exploring nearby parks and trails, writing, 
and working on open-source software projects.

## Technical Interests

#### Scientific Software

I'm very comfortable writing scientific software. I have developed software for space robotics
projects as an undergraduate and graduate student (C++), and I've developed open-source astrodynamics and 
robotics analysis tools (Julia). I have recently started developing open source software with Python.

#### Aerospace Controls

I emphasized applied controls and control theory throughout my undergraduate and graduate coursework. 
I'm familiar with applying linear analysis methods to nonlinear dynamical systems, and most 
of my graduate course projects related to studying nonlinear analysis methods. As a student, I primarily 
investigated region of attraction estimation methods, and coherent structure (manifold)
dynamics near equilibrium points. I studied flight dynamics relating to atmospheric vehicles, and 
spacecraft. I found a love for astrodynamics towards the end of my academic career!

#### Scientific Communication

I will be honing my scientific communication skills over the next few years by writing open source 
notes --- and [blog posts](/blog/) --- about technical topics of interest.
This process will contribute the growing list of free educational resources, and will help me to 
grow as a technical communicator. I've found that writing (and coding) technical concepts really helps me 
to solidify my own knowledge. I aspire to produce content in forms similar to MIT's excellent 
[Computational Thinking](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/) series!
