## Degrees

### B.S. Electrical Engineering

I studied electrical engineering at the University of Maryland from fall 2014 to spring 2021. 
I took a break from classes to work as an engineering intern at NASA during my fourth year. 
I graduated with an emphasis in controls; my senior year included several undergraduate 
courses related to control theory and applied controls. 

In spare time during semesters and academic breaks, I worked as an undergraduate research
assistant at the University of Maryland's [Space Systems Lab](https://ssl.umd.edu). I primarily 
developed software to operate and control the lab's [robotic manipulators](https://ssl.umd.edu/ranger). 
I enjoyed earning my open-water (scuba) certification to help with the lab's 
[neutral buoyancy](https://research.umd.edu/capabilities/core-facilities/neutral-buoyancy-research-facility-nbrf)
research!

### M.S. Aerospace Engineering

I began my M.S. degree in the fall immediately following my undergraduate graduation, and 
completed my M.S. degree in May 2021. My academic focus was Space Systems, though I also 
took a substantial number of courses relating to control theory and flight control. I worked 
as the [Space Systems Lab](https://ssl.umd.edu) lead software developer in my second 
year of graduate school. I developed the lab's kinematics and manipulator control 
interfaces using C++ and the [Robot Operating System](https://ros.org).

## Internships

### NASA JSC

I worked as an intern at [NASA's Johnson Space Center](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/home/index.html)
continuously from fall 2017 through summer 2018, and every summer following through 2020. 
I had the pleasure of exploring several roles, including as an avionics engineer and as a 
flight operations support engineer. I then worked four internships with an aerospace 
controls group, and solidified my love for developing flight software and analysis software.

### Harris Corporation

I worked as a radio-frequency engineer for Harris Corporation in the summer of 2016. I independently
wrote automation software using Visual Basic to complete a 20-hour data organization task in less than 
two minutes. I worked with another intern to implement an [ITU](https://www.itu.int/en/Pages/default.aspx) 
rain attenuation model using MATLAB and C#.

### SRI International

In the summer of 2015 I helped to annotate data for machine learning engineers. I also worked with 
another intern to develop a near-infrared LED array circuit board for gaze tracking applications.
