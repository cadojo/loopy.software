This section of the website serves as my professional portfolio. Most of the content relates
to my open source software development work, and public presentations I've given. You can 
find my **professional resume** at [`loopy.software/about/resume.pdf`](./resume.pdf). Otherwise,
head to my [Background](background/introduction/) page for more general information about me!
