It is my hope that this website has **no trackers at all** one day. Right now, I believe I'm a bit short of 
that goal. Some of the math-formatting libraries, e.g. MathJax, use cookies which browsers label 
trackers. In addition, on my blog-related pages, I use a MailChimp widget to add a subscription field.
That widget uses Javascript, and I believe there is a tracker embedded in that Javascript. MailChimp
also shows warnings on their website about information they give to Meta (Facebook). Gross! 

I'm going to work to remove these trackers over time. This site will always be free. I think the home 
page and portfolio pages have no trackers at all! That's motivating me to keep going with this goal.

Thank you [Quarto](https://quarto.org) for providing tracker-free website templates!
