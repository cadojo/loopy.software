This article is my opinion and response to HPD action at the Harris County Commissioners 
Court on October 11th, 2022. See Jen Rice's

:::

Resources paid for by taxpayers
should not be used as props for a partisan political 
stunt. The Houston Police Department (HPD) actions 
taken at the Harris County Commissioners Court on 
October 11th were wrong. Harris County taxpayers 
deserve to know how this event was planned, and the 
organizers and attendees within HPD who used government 
resources for partisan political gain should be held 
accountable.

The line between personal and professional actions may 
sometimes appear thin. For governments, extra care must 
be taken to prevent even the _appearance_ of impropriety. 
As a result, government employees have more to consider 
when planning political action, relative to other 
Americans. If an employee of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation wears an FBI baseball cap while they attend 
a political rally in a personal capacity, might they 
appear to be representing the agency? If Environmental 
Protection Agency employees use their government email 
accounts to organize a sit-in on the steps of the Supreme 
Court in protest of decisions relating to climate change, 
are they violating federal regulations? In my understanding, 
the answer to both of these questions is: yes.

The [laws and regulations](https://osc.gov/services/pages/hatchact-statelocal.aspx) 
which relate to the previous two examples are not superfluous. 
They help us --- as a nation --- walk that line between 
protecting the autonomy and rights of individuals, and trusting
the institutions we've assiged with running our society.
The spirit behind these guardrails is important. _These 
rules protect *you* from the government_. This is what it 
means to live in a country of laws. I am proud to live in a 
place which takes care to protect the independence of the 
institutions assigned with service to the public.

The actions taken by HPD officers at the Harris County Commissioner Court on October 11th 
were not nuanced, or anywhere close to the "ethical line". Officers in official uniforms 
brought [K-9 units](https://twitter.com/jen_rice_/status/1579863310685851650?s=20) 
and [weapons](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/houston/article/Harris-County-budget-live-updates-Police-presence-17501166.php) 
into the halls of the Commissioner Court. They 
[boo'd](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/houston/article/At-Harris-County-Commissioners-Court-budget-17502354.php) 
the commissioners as the meeting adjourned. They posed for a 
[picture](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/houston/article/Harris-County-budget-live-updates-Police-presence-17501166.php) with a 
banner that read: STOP DEFUNDING.

To me, the implicit intimidation on display by HPD officers 
against elected officials is chilling, and the political 
action predicated on a falsehood --- the 
[falsehood](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/opinion/editorials/article/Editorial-Now-Republicans-are-defunding-police-17464442.php) 
that Harris County officials have proposed defunding law 
enforcement --- is cynical and condescending toward all 
voters. That latter point is, to me, worsened by the fact 
that the officers _have to know_ that their funding is not 
in jeopardy; this necessarily means their actions at the 
Court were in furtherance of a politically expedient _lie_. 
Still, I understand that for Houston residents who are 
wary of national calls to re-allocate police funding, the 
rule-bending by HPD at the Court may feel like a small price 
to pay for a dramatic and public display of support for law 
enforcement funding. To those readers, I say this: no matter 
the issue, we cannot allow publicly funded apolitical 
institutions to participate in partisan politics. To let HPD 
off the hook for their misuse of taxpayer dollars is to fail 
to provide the guardrails necessary for all Americans to have 
faith in the institutions sworn to their service.
